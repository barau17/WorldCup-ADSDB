## Running the Project

To execute the code, follow these steps:

1. **Initial Data**: In the "Analytical Sandbox: CleanData and Stats" folder, you can find the initial files required for the project.

2. **Paths**: In the paths.py you have to change the ######CHANGE THIS IF YOU WANT TO EXECUTE IT IN YOUR MACHINE###### for the path where you copied the repository. So that every function can use the paths adequately.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Before running the project, you need to install all the necessary libraries and dependencies. You can use the following command to install them and execute the main code:

   ```bash
   pip install -r installDependencies.txt
   python3 main.py

4. **Execute the App**: Executing the app.py will start the interactive command line execution where different funcionalities were added:

   ```bash
   python3 app.py
